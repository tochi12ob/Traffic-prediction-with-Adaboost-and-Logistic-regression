# Traffic-prediction-with-Adaboost-and-Logistic-regression
## This was my submission for Datacamp's professional data scientist certification

The objectives of this  project revolve around two key goals: predicting recipes that will result in high traffic and achieving an 80% accuracy in predicting high traffic recipes.

To achieve these objectives, The initial step entailed a thorough examination of the recipe traffic dataset. The dataset comprises 947 observations across 8 columns. Within these columns, one corresponds to a unique recipe ID, while four are numerical variablesâ€”encompassing attributes like calories and three nutritional components. An additional two columns are categorical variables, representing "category" and "servings," respectively. Lastly, the final column serves as our target variable, indicating high traffic status.

I  meticulously addressed data preprocessing and cleaning tasks including:
removing duplicates,
managing missing values through replacement or deletion,
converting data types as needed, and more.

The data was ready for further analysis , which included visualizations of:

The  relationships among numerical variables. 

the  distribution patterns of calories and nutritional components within the recipes
Correlation between numerical variables , as well as the categorical variables 
And more (Do go through the notebook , for more insights)




After  data preprocessing, analysis, and model development,   both the Adaboost and Logistic Regression model addressed the business requirements/  objectives.
